      <p>
        I am a software developer from Rwanda, Kigali with a demonstrated history of software development in NodeJs, React, React-native and Python-Flask. A strong believer in the power of positive thinking, team spirit and I define every challenge as an opportunity to grow.

      <p>
      <span>â–¶</span>Outside of work, I like watching movies, coding, and enjoying family time.

      {/* <p>
        What I love most in software engineering is solving(contributing to
        solving) real-world problems through building software applications or
        tech in general and the joy that comes with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had also an adventure in networks and communication systems which was
        my major in my university studies and this enabled me to win 2018 cyber
        star.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than coding I like to watch movies, tv shows, comedy, music and
        enjoying family time.
