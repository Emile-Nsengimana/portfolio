      <p>
        Over the past years I dedicated my life to computer networks and
        programming. This journey started in my secondary studies and now I hold
        a Bachelor degree in Information Technology. It has been now 2 years
        since I started software developmentent as a career at Andela as an
        associate software engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I love most in software engineering is solving(contributing to
        solving) real-world problems through building software applications or
        tech in general and the joy that comes after.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had also an adventure in networks and communication systems which was
        my major in my university studies and this enabled me to win 2018 cyber
        star.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than coding I like to watch movies, tv shows, comedy, music and
        enjoying family time.
